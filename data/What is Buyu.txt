What is Buyu

Budo - Bujin - Buyu

One term for martial arts friend is buyu (武友). A true buyu spans over contries and decades. A quality of buyu is that they make you grow and continue to make you strive for more.


Budo is comprised of two characters the first is 'Bu' meaning martial, however the original Chinese picture gram ('Wu' in Chinese) signified to stop a spear, thus the deeper meaning is to prevent violence. The second character 'Do' (also pronounced 'Michi') refers to a way or higher path in life. Hatsumi Soke (Grandmaster of the Bujinkan) has often spoken of the aim of the Bujinkan being to foster world peace.

Taijutsu is also comprised of two characters, the first being 'Tai' meaning body (remember that the body and mind are not separated in the east as they are in the west) and the second character 'Jutsu', refers to an art or skill. Thus Budo Taijutsu can be seen as 'the art of making ones body skilfully, by following the martial way (of peace)'.

The Bujinkan Dojo takes it's name from Bujin 'Divine Warrior', that being the pen name of the late Takamatsu Soke (the previous Grandmaster) and 'Kan' refers to the place (or training hall in this case). Dojo means quite simply 'a place for leaning the way'.

Hatsumi Soke has spoken of 'Bufu Ikkan' - 'a primary inspiration that is drawn from the martial wind, that blows across the world connecting 'Buyu' martial friends'.

Martial arts should thus be viewed as a means of stopping violence, rather than adding to it. To use an analogy, we are the ecologist trying to enhance the quality of life, rather than polluters. Should we have to use martial arts skills, then we should do so, in the manner of putting a fire out, rather than making it burn fiercer. The true aim of Budo is the higher development of human qualities and a compassionate heart.
