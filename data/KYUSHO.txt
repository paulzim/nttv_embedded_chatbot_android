KYUSHO

Kyusho points, also known as vital points or pressure points, are specific areas of the human body that are more vulnerable to pain or injury when stimulated through techniques like strikes, pressure, or friction. These points are often linked to nerves, arteries, or veins and, when targeted, can cause a range of effects from pain and dizziness to potential incapacitation.
